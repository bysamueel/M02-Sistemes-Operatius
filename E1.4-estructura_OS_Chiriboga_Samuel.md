# E1. Exercise 4. Operating System structure

## Introduction

We can divide operating system in following parts:
- Kernel
- Memory manager
- Input/Output manager
- Filesystem manager

## Contents

Let's analyze operating system behaviour on each module. We will be using linux comands to see what's going on on a linux OS.

## Delivery

### Kernel

1. **Where does the kernel reside in disk?** Write down the command with the output and tell exactly where it is the kernel.
  
	The Kernel is hosted on /boot directory
  
2. **How can we show the actual kernel version that it is loaded on our system**? Please show command output
  
	#uname -a  
	#Linux 3.2.45-smp i686  
		- Linux : Name of the Kernel  
		- 3.2.45-smp : Kernel Version  
		- i686 : Type of Hardware on our machine   
  
3. **How can we show the detected hardware done by the kernel?** Please show command output.

4. **How can we show the actual 'out of memory score' of a Gimp instance that it is running?**
  
  ps auxf | gimp

2. **In multiprocessor systems, how does the operating system distribute interrupts by default?** How can we change the default behaviour?
  
  The O.S distributes them in each kernel . We can change the default behavior with command #tuned-adm list
  
3. **How does an operating system control a device that has no interrupts?** Explain the process 
  
  With POLLING , what he checks if there are data in the devices every time
  
4. **What will happen if two applications want to send data through network device at the same time?**
  
  Only one will work , he'll be the most important
  
  
### Filesystem manager

1. **Which is the typical linux folder structure? ** Describe what it is and the use of each folder.
  
- bin: In this directory we can find all the executable files of the system.
- boot: All the fundamental files for the system boot, this is where the Grub program is located.
- dev: This is where all the drivers and devices connected to the computer are, in GNU / Linux they are as if they were files.
- etc: Contains the configuration files of the operating system and the different programs at a general level.
- home: Here you can find all the files of the users of the system.
- lib: Contains the essential libraries used by the programs found in / bin, / sbin and the core of the system.
- lib64: Contains the essential libraries for 64 bits systems
- lost + found: Specific directory for lost files.
- media: It is where the CD, DVD, hard drives and USB drives are mounted.
- mnt: Empty directory, has the same functions as / media.
- opt: In this directory, applications are usually installed with the intention of being only in the specific computer where they are entered.
- proc: Contains a virtual file system, is used to provide information related to the process system
- root: Particular directory of the superuser of the system
- run: contains system information and is deleted every time it is restarted
- sbin: Contains binary system administration commands / programs.
- srv: Directory used by the servers that we have installed on the computer.
- sys: Contains information about the devices connected to the computer.
- tmp: Temporary directory for temporary system files.
- usr: It is used to install third-party applications and can be shared by several networked computers.
- var: Contains several files that define the system as well as log files that store every movement of the system
  
2. **How can we:?**
- Move a file that resides in /usr/local/src/file.md to the folder /opt:  
  
  * mv /usr/local/src/file.md opt *
  
- Copy a file that resides in /usr/local/src/file.md to the folder /opt:
  
  * cp /usr/local/src/file.md opt *
  
- Move a file in /usr/file.md to /usr/local if we are currently in path /usr/local:  
  
  * mv /usr/local/file.md *
  
- Create the file .gitignore using command 'touch' and then try to list it (ls). What happens?  
  
	root@debian9:~# touch .gitignore  
	root@debian9:~# ls  
	root@debian9:~# ls .gitignore  
	.gitignore  
	root@debian9:~# 
	
	The file doesn't appear doing a "ls" 'cause the files with a dot (.) non appear , but doing "ls .gitignore" we'll see ".gitignore
